# Hangman

This is a game in which the user is attemtping to guess a word that the computer has generated by guessing letters that might occur in the word. Every wrong answer causes the user to lose a 'limb'. Once the user is out of 'limbs' then the game is over and a 'loss' is recorded. If the user guesses correctly, a 'win' is recorded and the game continues.
